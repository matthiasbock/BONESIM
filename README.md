Boolean Network Simulator
==================

This software allows to visualize and interactively simulate Boolean networks
i.e. networks in which each node can assume one of two possible states and
where the dependency of node states from the states of other nodes
are described using logical equations.
Different file formats are supported for import and export.
This software was created for the modeling of biological signaling cascades,
but is not limited to this application.

This project was inspired by previous work (see also https://github.com/biographer).

Have fun!
